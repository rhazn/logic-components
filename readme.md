# Logic components

logic-components aims to provide a library with common interface elements to implement tools in belief change research. Components are implemented as [HTML Custom Elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements) and therefore framework agnostic and work in a [wide variety of browsers](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1).

## Documentation
Components are found in the `src/components` directory. A readme.md file is generated for every component in its folder.

## Usage
logic-components is available on npm: `npm i @rhazn/logic-components`
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhazn/logic-components).

A sibling repository for exposing the components as react components is available here: https://github.com/rhazn/logic-components-react.
